<h1>Movies that got the job done!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars Rogue One</h3>
<p>This movie was well written and was one of the darkest Star Wars movies that was ever made.</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>I firs saw this when I was in middle school and the teacher had our class gather to watch it in the theater. I didn't just pick this because of the steamy scene with Leo and Kate.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Jurassic Park was one of the first movies that pulled me into another world. It got us all thinking about what it would be like to have dinosaurs living amongst us.</p>
